Simple backup system with `backup` and `restore` commands.

Configure the destinations and the files to be backed up in
$HOME/.config/backup/backuprc.

Share backuprc's with several devices and you can `backup` and `restore`
to establish a primitive file synching between them.


Caveats:

- The file names listed in backuprc CANNOT have spaces in them.  Files
  in subdirectores CAN have spaces.

- Only one backup exists at a time and the act of backing up deletes
  files on the remote host that don't exist on the local host.
